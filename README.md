# P103-Algorithms_and_Data_Structures

My first course that introduced me to smart and efficient ways to solve problems. My favorite course by far! The algorithms that are present here rely on mathematical and programming tricks to efficiently solve somewhat tough problems. Always say no to brute force! If you're doomed to write an algorithm that uses brute force, at least give backtracking a shot.
