# P103-Algorithms_and_Data_Structures

The first course that introduced smart and efficient ways to solve problems. My favorite course by far! The algorithms that are present here rely on mathematical and programming tricks to efficiently solve somewhat tough problems. Always say no to brute force! If you find yourself cornered to write an algorithm that uses brute force, at least give backtracking a shot.
